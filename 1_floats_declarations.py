Floats!

# Declare a float variable
float_variable = 10.0

# Floats are numbers that have a decimal point in them.
# They can be declared in two ways:
# 1. Using a decimal point
float_variable = 420.69
print(float_variable)

# 2. Using scientific notation
float_variable = 4.2e-1 #This is equivalent to 4.2 * 10^-1
print(float_variable)

# Floats support all the math operations that integers do.
#Not gonna go through the same operations again.

# Comparisons between floats and integers can be made.
# For example:

float_variable = 10.0
integer_variable = 12

print(float_variable > integer_variable)

#Ok, you get the idea. Floats are numbers with decimal points.
